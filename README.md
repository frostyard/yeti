# yeti

Scheduled GitHub automation powered by the Claude CLI.

Yeti periodically scans GitHub repositories and uses Claude to:

- **Plan issues** — issues labelled `Needs Refinement` get an AI-generated implementation plan posted as a comment
- **Work issues** — issues labelled `Refined` are picked up, implemented in an isolated worktree, and submitted as a PR
- **Fix CI** — open PRs with failing checks are analysed and patched automatically

## How it works

Three jobs run on simple timers (5 min for issues, 10 min for CI). Each job:

1. Queries GitHub via the `gh` CLI for matching issues/PRs
2. Creates a git worktree for isolation
3. Runs the `claude` CLI with a task-specific prompt
4. Pushes results (PR, comment, or commits) back to GitHub
5. Cleans up the worktree

A serial queue ensures only one Claude process runs at a time. Labels (`yeti-working`, etc.) coordinate state and prevent duplicate work.

## Deployment

Yeti runs as a systemd service on a Linux server. An accompanying timer-based updater automatically pulls new GitHub releases, swaps the build artefacts, and restarts the service (with automatic rollback on health-check failure).

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Node.js 22 | Runtime |
| `gh` CLI | GitHub API access (must be authenticated) |
| `claude` CLI | AI execution (default backend) |
| `copilot` CLI | AI execution (optional second backend for adversarial review) |
| `git` | Worktree management |

### Building

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

### Installing

```sh
gh api repos/frostyard/yeti/contents/deploy/install.sh --jq .content | base64 -d | bash
```

This downloads the latest release to `/opt/yeti`, installs the systemd units (templated to the current user), and starts the service. Requires `gh` CLI to be installed and authenticated.

### Running

The service is managed by systemd:

```sh
sudo systemctl start yeti      # start
sudo systemctl stop yeti       # stop (sends SIGTERM, waits for in-flight jobs)
sudo systemctl status yeti     # check status
journalctl -u yeti -f          # tail logs
```

The process handles `SIGTERM` gracefully, so systemd can stop it cleanly.

### Auto-updates

The `yeti-updater.timer` checks for new GitHub releases every 60 seconds. When a new release is found, `deploy/deploy.sh` downloads the tarball, swaps the `dist/` directory, restarts the service, and verifies health via `http://localhost:9384/health`. If the health check fails, it automatically rolls back to the previous version.

## Upgrading

### `enabledJobs` migration (required)

Starting from the release that introduces `enabledJobs`, you must explicitly list which jobs to run in `~/.yeti/config.json`. Without this field, **no jobs will start**.

**Before upgrading**, add `enabledJobs` to your config:

```json
{
  "enabledJobs": [
    "issue-worker",
    "issue-refiner",
    "ci-fixer",
    "review-addresser",
    "doc-maintainer",
    "auto-merger",
    "repo-standards",
    "improvement-identifier",
    "issue-auditor",
    "triage-yeti-errors"
  ]
}
```

The example above enables all jobs (matching previous default behavior). Remove any jobs you don't want to run.

**If you upgrade without updating config**, yeti will start but log a warning: *"No jobs enabled — yeti is running but idle."* You can then add `enabledJobs` to your config and yeti will pick it up via live reload — no restart needed.

## Configuration

Configuration is resolved per-field in this priority order:

1. **Environment variables** (highest priority)
2. **Config file** at `~/.yeti/config.json`
3. **Hardcoded defaults** (where a sensible default exists)

### All configuration options

| Config key | Env variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `githubOwners` | `YETI_GITHUB_OWNERS` | `["frostyard","frostyard"]` | GitHub accounts to scan (env var is comma-separated) |
| `selfRepo` | `YETI_SELF_REPO` | `frostyard/yeti` | Repo used for self-referencing error issues |
| `port` | `PORT` | `9384` | HTTP server port |
| `intervals.issueWorkerMs` | — | `300000` (5 min) | Issue worker poll interval |
| `intervals.issueRefinerMs` | — | `300000` (5 min) | Issue refiner poll interval |
| `intervals.ciFixerMs` | — | `600000` (10 min) | CI fixer poll interval |
| `intervals.reviewAddresserMs` | — | `300000` (5 min) | Review addresser poll interval |
| `allowedRepos` | `YETI_ALLOWED_REPOS` | *(absent — no filtering)* | Repo short-name allow-list (env var is comma-separated). Self-repo always included. |
| `enabledJobs` | — | `[]` (no jobs) | Which jobs to register with the scheduler (live-reloadable) |

### Migrating to `allowedRepos`

By default, `allowedRepos` is absent from your config, which means all discovered repos are processed — **no action is required on upgrade**. To restrict which repos Yeti operates on:

1. Add `allowedRepos` to `~/.yeti/config.json` with the short names of repos you want Yeti to manage:

```json
{
  "allowedRepos": ["yeti", "my-app", "docs"]
}
```

2. The self-repo (e.g., `yeti`) is always included implicitly — you don't need to list it, but it's fine if you do.

3. An empty list (`[]`) means only the self-repo gets jobs. To process no repos at all, pause all jobs instead.

4. Repo names are case-insensitive and apply across all configured `githubOwners`.

### External tool authentication

These tools must be installed and authenticated on the host — they are **not** configured through `config.json` or environment variables:

| Tool | How to authenticate |
|---|---|
| `gh` CLI | `gh auth login` — must have access to all repos in `githubOwners` |
| `claude` CLI | Follow [Claude CLI setup](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-cli) |

## Jobs

Yeti runs 10 jobs on timers. Each job scans repos under the configured `githubOwners`, filtered by `allowedRepos` if set. Understanding what triggers each job is important — **most jobs do not require labels** and will discover work based on PR/issue state.

### Jobs that require labels

| Job | Trigger | What it does |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| **issue-worker** | `Refined` label on issue | Implements the issue in an isolated worktree, submits a PR |

### Jobs that act on existing Yeti work

These only fire when Yeti has already created branches or issues:

| Job | Trigger | What it does |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| **review-addresser** | `yeti/` branch PR with review comments | Addresses reviewer feedback on Yeti-created PRs |
| **triage-yeti-errors** | Issue with `[yeti-error]` in title | Investigates Yeti error issues |
| **repo-standards** | Periodic (daily) | Syncs label definitions — does not create PRs or issues |

### Jobs that act on ANY matching issue or PR

These scan all open issues/PRs and will do work without any Yeti-specific labels:

| Job | Trigger | What it does |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| **issue-refiner** | Issues labelled `Needs Refinement` | Generates an implementation plan comment |
| **plan-reviewer** | Issues labelled `Needs Plan Review` | Adversarial review of plans using a different AI backend |
| **ci-fixer** | Any PR with failing checks or merge conflicts | Attempts to fix CI failures and conflicts |
| **improvement-identifier** | Periodic scan of codebase | Creates PRs for code improvement opportunities |
| **issue-auditor** | All open issues | Audits and classifies issue state, applies labels |
| **doc-maintainer** | Code changes since last doc update | Updates documentation (only on already-cloned repos) |

### Auto-merge behaviour

The **auto-merger** job will merge PRs without human approval in these cases:

| PR type | Human review required? | Conditions for auto-merge |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Dependabot PRs** | No | All checks passing |
| **Doc PRs** (`yeti/docs-*`) | No | Only `.md` or `yeti/` files changed; checks pass or no checks configured |
| **Issue PRs** (`yeti/issue-*`) | **Yes** — requires LGTM | A valid LGTM comment must be posted after the latest commit |

All other PRs (non-Yeti, non-Dependabot) are ignored by auto-merger.

### Label workflow

Issues move through labels to track state:

```
(new issue)         →  (refiner runs)  →  Plan comment posted  →  Ready
                    →  (reviewer runs) →  Plan reviewed         →  Ready  [if plan-reviewer enabled]
                    →  Human reviews plan + critique, then either:
                         • Adds "Refined" to approve implementation
                         • Posts feedback → refiner refines → reviewer re-reviews
Refined             →  (worker runs)   →  PR created  →  In Review
In Review + LGTM    →  (merger runs)   →  PR merged
```

The `Ready` label always means "waiting for a human decision." When plan-reviewer is enabled, the human sees both the plan and an adversarial critique before deciding whether to proceed. The review is **for the human**, not for automatic refinement — this prevents infinite back-and-forth between AIs.

The `Priority` label is used for queue ordering across all jobs but does not trigger any job on its own.
