# Yeti — Overview

Yeti is a self-hosted
GitHub automation service. It polls GitHub repositories on configurable timers
(and optionally receives GitHub webhooks for near-real-time triggers),
identifies work items via comment analysis, reactions, and PR state, and
delegates tasks to the Claude CLI in isolated git worktrees. It runs as a
Linux systemd service.

### Module Responsibilities

See [Modules](modules.md) for detailed descriptions of each module. Key relationships:

- **`main.ts`** wires everything: DB init, crash recovery, job registration, config reload, graceful shutdown
- **`config.ts`** loads config (env > config.json > defaults); exports `LABELS`, `INTERVALS`, `SCHEDULES`, `ENABLED_JOBS`
- **`scheduler.ts`** runs jobs on intervals or daily schedules with skip-if-busy semantics
- **`github.ts`** wraps `gh` CLI with retry, rate-limit circuit breaker, TTL cache, and queue cache
- **`github-app.ts`** optional GitHub App auth (JWT signing, installation tokens, `GH_TOKEN` injection)
- **`oauth.ts`** optional GitHub OAuth for dashboard sign-in (stateless HMAC cookies, org membership check)
- **`claude.ts`** multi-backend AI dispatch (3 bounded queues) + git worktree helpers
- **`db.ts`** SQLite with `tasks`, `job_runs`, `job_logs` tables — see [Database Schema](database-schema.md)
- **`server.ts`** HTTP dashboard + API routes + webhook endpoint
- **`webhooks.ts`** GitHub webhook handler (HMAC-verified, routes label/check events to job triggers)
- **`log.ts`** level-gated logging captured to DB via `AsyncLocalStorage`
- **`error-reporter.ts`** deduplicating error reporter (GitHub issues + Discord, 30-min cooldown)
- **`images.ts`** extracts/downloads images and file attachments for AI context
- **`plan-parser.ts`** parses multi-PR implementation plans into phases
- **`notify.ts`** / **`discord.ts`** notification dispatch and Discord bot commands
- **`startup-announce.ts`** announces new deployments; **`shutdown.ts`** shared shutdown flag

## Jobs

Thirteen scheduled jobs run on timers or schedules.
See [Jobs](jobs.md) for detailed behavior of each.

| Job | Trigger | Interval | Summary |
|-----|---------|----------|---------|
| `issue-refiner` | Issues labelled `Needs Refinement` | 5 min | Posts implementation plans for issues with `Needs Refinement` label (exempt: `[ci-unrelated]` and `[yeti-error]` issues); asks clarifying questions for underspecified issues instead of guessing; refines plans based on unreacted human feedback; responds to follow-up questions on issues with open PRs |
| `plan-reviewer` | Issues labelled `Needs Plan Review` | 10 min | Adversarial review of implementation plans using configurable AI backend |
| `issue-worker` | Label `Refined` | 5 min | Implements the issue, creates a PR |
| `ci-fixer` | Any open PR with failing checks | 10 min | Resolves merge conflicts, fixes CI failures |
| `review-addresser` | Yeti PRs with unreacted review comments | 5 min | Fetches unresolved review comments, pushes fix commits, reacts with thumbsup to track addressed comments |
| `triage-yeti-errors` | `[yeti-error]` issues in `SELF_REPO` | 10 min | Investigates internal Yeti errors, deduplicates by fingerprint, posts report |
| `doc-maintainer` | Daily at 1 AM | Scheduled | Updates `yeti/` to reflect current codebase |
| `auto-merger` | Dependabot PRs + LGTM'd Yeti PRs + doc PRs | 10 min | Squash-merges PRs when conditions are met; silently skips branch-protected repos |
| `repo-standards` | Daily at 2 AM (+ on startup) | Scheduled | Syncs labels and cleans legacy labels |
| `improvement-identifier` | Daily at 3 AM | Scheduled | Analyzes codebase via Claude, implements improvements as PRs |
| `mkdocs-update` | Daily at 4 AM | Scheduled | Updates MkDocs documentation from recent source code changes |
| `issue-auditor` | Daily at 5 AM | Scheduled | Reconciles issue states, manages Ready and In Review labels |
| `prompt-evaluator` | Daily at midnight | Scheduled | A/B tests plan-producing prompts against AI-generated variants, files issues for improvements |

## Key Patterns

### Content-Based State Machine

Issues and PRs are discovered by analysing comments, reactions, and PR state —
not labels. Six labels are used:

- `Needs Refinement` — trigger for issue-refiner (requests an AI-generated implementation plan)
- `Needs Plan Review` — trigger for plan-reviewer (requests adversarial AI review of the plan)
- `Refined` — trigger for issue-worker (requests implementation of the plan)
- `Ready` — informational, signals "Yeti is done, your turn"
- `In Review` — informational, signals an issue has an open PR under review
- `Priority` — high-priority items processed first in all Yeti queues

```
Issues:
  Needs Refinement label →  (refiner posts plan)         →  Needs Plan Review added (if plan-reviewer enabled) or Ready added
  Needs Plan Review label → (plan-reviewer critiques)    →  Ready added (default) or Needs Refinement (if reviewLoop + NEEDS REVISION + under maxPlanRounds)
  Unreacted feedback     →  (refiner refines plan)       →  Needs Plan Review or Ready label re-added
  Open PR + follow-up Q  →  (refiner posts response)     →  👍 reactions added (no label changes)
  Refined label          →  (worker creates PR)          →  Refined removed, Ready removed, In Review added
  [yeti-error] title    →  (triage-yeti-errors)        →  investigation report posted

PRs:
  Unreacted review comments  →  (review-addresser)  →  👍 reactions added, Ready added
  Dependabot or LGTM'd Yeti PR + passing CI  →  (auto-merger)  →  merged, In Review removed
  Doc PR (yeti/docs-*) + doc-only files + CI passing/skipped  →  (auto-merger)  →  merged (no LGTM required)
```

Jobs track processed items via 👍 reactions on comments (issue-refiner,
review-addresser) and by checking for existing report comments (triage jobs).
The issue-auditor reconciles label state daily, adding missing `In Review`
labels to issues with open PRs and removing stale ones.

### Multi-Backend AI Dispatch

All AI invocations go through `claude.ts`, which manages three independent
bounded concurrent queues — one per backend (Claude, Copilot, Codex). Each
queue has its own concurrency limit and timeout:

| Backend | Queue | Workers config | Default | Timeout config | Default |
|---------|-------|----------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Claude | `enqueue` | `maxClaudeWorkers` | 2 | `claudeTimeoutMs` | 20 min |
| Copilot | `enqueueCopilot` | `maxCopilotWorkers` | 1 | `copilotTimeoutMs` | 20 min |
| Codex | `enqueueCodex` | `maxCodexWorkers` | 1 | `codexTimeoutMs` | 20 min |

All jobs use `resolveEnqueue(aiOptions)` to select the correct queue based on
the `JOB_AI` config for that job, then call `runAI()` for backend-agnostic
execution. This means any job can be switched to a different AI backend by
setting `jobAi.<job-name>.backend` in `config.json` — no code changes needed.

Each process has a configurable timeout with SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation. A
5-minute heartbeat logs PID, elapsed time, and stdout byte count. Timed-out
processes throw `ClaudeTimeoutError` with diagnostic fields, surfaced in error
reports for debugging. `runAI()` rejects its promise on non-zero exit codes
(error includes exit code and first 500 bytes of stderr), ensuring AI process
failures propagate to job-level error handling and `reportError()` rather than
being silently swallowed.

### Skip-If-Busy Scheduling

Jobs that fire while a prior instance is still running are silently dropped —
no queue pile-up. This is distinct from the Claude task queue; a job can be
"running" while waiting in the Claude queue.

### Worktree Isolation

Each task gets its own git worktree at
`~/.yeti/worktrees/<owner>/<repo>/<job>/<branch>`. The job namespace prevents
filesystem path collisions. Worktrees for existing branches use detached HEAD
mode, allowing multiple jobs to work on the same branch concurrently without
git's branch-lock conflict. The main clone lives at
`~/.yeti/repos/<owner>/<repo>`. Worktrees are always cleaned up in a `finally`
block after each task.

### Graceful Shutdown

On SIGINT/SIGTERM, `main.ts` cancels all queued (not yet started) Claude tasks,
drains running jobs (5-minute timeout), terminates any in-flight Claude
processes (5-second grace period), closes the database, and exits. The
`shutdown.ts` module provides a shared `isShuttingDown()` flag that prevents
the Claude queue from accepting new tasks during shutdown. Cancelled tasks
throw `ShutdownError` (a distinct error class), which the error reporter
suppresses — no notifications or GitHub issues are created for shutdown
cancellations.

### Crash Recovery

At startup, any tasks still marked `running` in the database (from a previous
crash) have their worktrees cleaned up and are marked `failed`.

### Transient Retry & Rate Limit Circuit Breaker

The `gh` CLI wrapper retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s,
4s) on transient errors (400, 500, 502, 503, 504, timeouts, connection resets,
"Could not resolve to a", "TLS handshake timeout", "Something went wrong",
"stream error" — HTTP/2 stream cancellations).
Rate limit errors are handled separately: they trip a circuit breaker that
blocks all GitHub API calls for 60 seconds, throwing `RateLimitError`
immediately without retry. A notification is sent when the
circuit breaker trips, and another when the first API call succeeds after
cooldown expires. Jobs that iterate over repos short-circuit their loops via
`isRateLimited()` to avoid cascading failures during a rate-limit window.

### Error Reporting & Investigation Pipeline

Errors flow through two stages:

1. **Error reporter** (`error-reporter.ts`) — Uses a 30-minute cooldown per
   fingerprint. Recurrences add comments to the existing `[yeti-error]` issue
   rather than opening new ones. `ShutdownError` and `RateLimitError` are
   filtered before any reporting.
2. **Triage** (`triage-yeti-errors.ts`) — Discovers `[yeti-error]` issues
   by title pattern (no label required), runs two-phase deduplication (by
   fingerprint before investigation, then by root cause after), and posts an
   investigation report. Reads `yeti/OVERVIEW.md` for context and identifies
   related issues that share the same root cause.

### CI-Fixer Two-Phase Design

The ci-fixer uses a two-phase identify/process pattern (matching the pattern
used by improvement-identifier and issue-refiner):

1. **Identify**: Scans all PRs, checks merge state, CI status, and classifies
   failures — collects typed `WorkItem` entries (a discriminated union with
   variants: `conflict`, `rerun`, `unrelated`, `fix`)
2. **Process**: Groups unrelated failures by repo (structural dedup — one
   consolidated issue per repo), then processes remaining items concurrently

This eliminates race conditions when multiple PRs in the same repo have
unrelated CI failures — without the grouping, concurrent `searchIssues` +
`createIssue` calls would produce duplicate issues.

Reruns are emitted both for cancelled/startup-failure workflows and when
failure log fetching returns empty (the `getFailedRunLog` two-tier fallback —
CLI then REST API — both returned no output). Benign "already running" errors
(a harmless race condition where the workflow restarted between detection and
rerun) are caught and logged at info level rather than reported as errors.

**`[ci-unrelated]` fix PRs**: When ci-fixer processes a PR whose title
contains `[ci-unrelated]` (i.e., a PR created by issue-worker to fix a
`[ci-unrelated]` issue), it skips the classification step entirely and treats
all CI failures as related. Without this guard, the classifier would see the
pre-existing failures, classify them as "unrelated to the PR's changes", and
the PR would stall indefinitely in a loop of filing redundant issues and
reverting fix attempts. Errors on these PRs are posted as comments directly
on the PR rather than creating `[yeti-error]` issues.

### Image & Attachment Context

When processing issues or PR reviews, `images.ts` extracts embedded image
references and GitHub file attachments from the text, downloads them, and
appends prompt sections so Claude can view images and read attached files.
Images are saved into the worktree; text attachments are inlined in the
prompt. This is used by issue-refiner, issue-worker, and review-addresser.

### Documentation as Context

Issue-refiner, issue-worker, improvement-identifier, and triage-yeti-errors
prompts instruct Claude to read `yeti/OVERVIEW.md` (and linked docs) before
starting work. This gives Claude accumulated architectural context about each
repository.

### Branch Naming

| Job | Pattern |
|-----|---------|
| issue-refiner | `yeti/plan-<N>-<hex4>` |
| issue-worker | `yeti/issue-<N>-<hex4>` |
| triage-yeti-errors | `yeti/investigate-error-<N>-<hex4>` |
| doc-maintainer | `yeti/docs-<YYYYMMDD>-<hex4>` |
| improvement-identifier | `yeti/improve-<hex4>` |
| mkdocs-update | `yeti/mkdocs-update-<YYYYMMDD>-<hex4>` |
| ci-fixer / review-addresser | Uses existing PR branch |

### PR Title Conventions

- `fix: resolve #N — <title>` — single-PR issue implementations
- `fix(#N): <phase title> (X/Y)` — multi-PR issue phases
- `refactor: <title>` — automated improvements
- `docs: update documentation for <repo>` — doc maintenance
- `docs: update mkdocs content for <repo>` — mkdocs updates

### Tree-Diff Guard

All PR-creating jobs gate on both `hasNewCommits` (commit count vs base) and
`hasTreeDiff` (actual tree difference via `git diff --quiet`) before
pushing or creating PRs. This prevents failures when Claude makes commits
that produce no effective changes (e.g. reverting its own work). Jobs that
push to existing PR branches (ci-fixer, review-addresser) also use this
check to avoid pushing identical trees.

### Duplicate PR Guards

PR-creating jobs check for existing open PRs before creating new ones to
prevent pile-up when previous PRs haven't been merged:

- **doc-maintainer**: Skips if an open `yeti/docs-*` PR exists
- **improvement-identifier**: Skips if any open `yeti/improve-*` PR exists
- **mkdocs-update**: Skips if an open `yeti/mkdocs-update-*` PR exists
- **ci-fixer**: Uses consolidated per-repo `[ci-unrelated]` issues rather
  than per-fingerprint issues, so all unrelated CI failures for a repo
  are tracked in a single issue

`getOpenPRForIssue()` (used by issue-worker) bypasses the `listPRs` TTL
cache (`fresh: true`) to avoid race conditions where a concurrent PR is
invisible during the 60-second cache window.

### Item Skip & Prioritize

Individual issues/PRs can be skipped or prioritized via `skippedItems` and
`prioritizedItems` in `config.json` (arrays of `{repo, number}`), or via
the dashboard queue page buttons (`POST /queue/skip`, `/queue/prioritize`).
Skipped items are excluded from all job processing via `isItemSkipped()`.
Prioritized items are processed before others in job queues via
`isItemPrioritized()`. Both lists are hot-reloadable.

### Job Pause/Resume

Individual jobs can be paused and resumed via the dashboard (`POST /pause/:job`)
or pre-configured via `pausedJobs` in `config.json`. Paused jobs skip their
scheduled ticks but can still be triggered manually.

### Commit Tag

Doc-maintainer commits include `[doc-maintainer]` in the message. This is used
by `getLastDocMaintainerSha()` to detect whether docs are already up-to-date.

## Configuration

Configuration is resolved per-field: env vars > `~/.yeti/config.json` >

| `discordBotToken` | `YETI_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | *(empty — Discord disabled if unset)* |
| `discordChannelId` | `YETI_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | *(empty)* |
| `discordAllowedUsers` | `YETI_DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS` | `[]` (comma-separated user IDs) |

| `pausedJobs` | — | `[]` (job names to pause on startup) |
| `enabledJobs` | — | `[]` (job names to register with the scheduler; empty = no jobs run) |
| `skippedItems` | — | `[]` (array of `{repo, number}` excluded from processing) |
| `allowedRepos` | `YETI_ALLOWED_REPOS` | `null` (all repos) |
| `prioritizedItems` | — | `[]` (array of `{repo, number}` processed first) |
| `queueScanIntervalMs` | — | `300000` (5 min — how often the dashboard queue refreshes from GitHub labels; infrastructure, always runs) |
| `reviewLoop` | — | `false` (when true, plan-reviewer can send plans back to issue-refiner for re-refinement) |
| `maxPlanRounds` | — | `3` (max plan→review cycles before falling through to human review; minimum 1) |

### enabledJobs

Controls which jobs are registered with the scheduler at startup.

- **Field**: `enabledJobs` (string array)
- **Default**: `[]` — no jobs run if the field is absent or empty
- **Live-reloadable**: yes (changes take effect without restart)
- **Available values**: `issue-worker`, `issue-refiner`, `plan-reviewer`, `ci-fixer`, `review-addresser`, `doc-maintainer`, `auto-merger`, `repo-standards`, `improvement-identifier`, `issue-auditor`, `triage-yeti-errors`, `mkdocs-update`, `prompt-evaluator`

**Migration note**: existing configs without `enabledJobs` will have no jobs start after upgrading. Add the desired job names to `enabledJobs` in `~/.yeti/config.json` before upgrading.

### allowedRepos

Restricts which repositories Yeti processes. Applied as a filter on `listRepos()`.

- **Field**: `allowedRepos` (string array or `null`)
- **Env var**: `YETI_ALLOWED_REPOS` (comma-separated)
- **Default**: `null` — no filtering, all discovered repos are processed
- **Live-reloadable**: yes
- `null` = all repos; `[]` = selfRepo only; `["repo-a", "repo-b"]` = those repos + selfRepo
- `selfRepo` is always included regardless of the list (ensures Yeti can always process its own error issues)
- Matching is case-insensitive; uses short repo names (not `owner/repo`)
- Warns at runtime if a configured name doesn't match any discovered repository (includes a hint about `includeForks` when fork discovery is disabled)
- Editable via the dashboard config UI; empty input maps to `[]` (no repos except selfRepo), not `null` (all repos). To restore `null` (all repos), remove the `allowedRepos` key from `config.json` directly.

### includeForks

Controls whether forked repositories are included in discovery.

- **Field**: `includeForks` (boolean)
- **Env var**: `YETI_INCLUDE_FORKS`
- **Default**: `false` — only source (non-fork) repos are discovered via `gh repo list --source`
- **Live-reloadable**: yes (clearing both the repo cache and the all-org-repos cache)
- When `true`, the `--source` flag is omitted from `gh repo list`, so forks in the org appear alongside source repos
- Affects both `listRepos()` (worker discovery) and `listAllOrgRepos()` (Repos onboarding page)
- PRs created on forks stay within the fork — `gh pr create --repo <fork>` targets the fork, not the upstream parent

Config changes made via the web UI (`POST /config`) take effect immediately
at runtime — no restart required. The config module uses ESM live bindings
(`export let`) so all consumers see updated values on their next access.
Interval and schedule changes are propagated to the scheduler via
`onConfigChange()` listeners that call `updateInterval()` /
`updateScheduledHour()`. The only exception is `port` (requires socket
re-bind), which is shown as read-only in the UI.

Env vars always take priority over `config.json`. Fields set via env var
are shown as disabled in the config UI with a note indicating the override.

External tools `gh` and `claude` must be authenticated separately — Yeti does
not manage their credentials.

The Discord integration requires creating a Discord application, bot token, and private channel. See
[Discord Setup](discord-setup.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 22
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, ES2022 target, Node16 modules, ESM)
- **Database**: SQLite via better-sqlite3 (WAL mode)
- **Testing**: Vitest — co-located test files, heavy mocking of external boundaries
- **CI**: GitHub Actions on self-hosted runner — build + test on every push
- **History cleanup**: Workflow-dispatch action for branch cleanup and `git-filter-repo` to audit/scrub git secrets
- **Releases**: Date-based version tags (`v<YYYY-MM-DD>.<N>`), self-describing tarball attached to GitHub Release (includes `.repo` file identifying the source repository)
- **Auto-updates**: systemd timer checks for new releases every 60s, downloads + swaps + health checks with automatic rollback
- **Multi-instance deploy**: Release tarballs embed a `.repo` file so multiple instances (from different forks) can run independently on the same host

## Deployment & Multi-Instance Support

Release tarballs are **self-describing**: the CI workflow writes the source
repository (`owner/repo`) into a `.repo` file embedded in the tarball. Both
`deploy.sh` and `install.sh` use a three-level fallback to determine which
GitHub repository to monitor for updates:

1. `$INSTALL_DIR/.repo` — from the release tarball (highest priority)
2. `selfRepo` from `~/.yeti/config.json` — manual override
3. Default `frostyard/yeti` — backwards compatibility

This enables **multi-instance deployments**: different forks of Yeti can each
release their own tarball, and multiple instances can coexist on the same host
(using different `INSTALL_DIR` or systemd units), each self-updating from its
own fork's releases. The `install.sh` bootstrap script pre-populates
`selfRepo` and `githubOwners` in the initial config from the detected repo.

**Dynamic user detection**: `deploy.sh` resolves the service user dynamically
by reading the `User=` directive from the installed systemd unit file
(`/etc/systemd/system/yeti.service`), then derives the home directory via
`getent passwd`. This avoids hardcoding a username, allowing the service to
run as any user without modifying deploy scripts.
